This is my 5th project, showcasing the knowledge gained during "100 days of code" course. Like all the other project, I wrote it myself. 
This project is "Type speed test"app with the usage of Tkinter.

Rules of the game: You need to write the words above in the same order as fast as you can within 1 minute.
The test will give a result of how many words you manged to write during that time.
After pressing "start" button, the counting will begin at the moment you will start writing your first word. Words written correctly will be marked in green on the list of words, and the wrong ones wil be marked in red.
You can reset the game and start over using "reset" button.
After one minute a pop-up window will appear, with your results.
After finishing the game once, you may start again with the word in the same order, or you may shuffle them to increase difficulty.

I hope you will enjoy the game!

If you can improve my code, feel free to do so! I'm still learning so all tips are welcome!
